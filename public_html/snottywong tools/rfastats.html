<h1>RfA Vote Counter</h1>
<div style="width:875px;">This tool will analyze the voting history of a user at &quot;Wikipedia:Requests for Adminship&quot; and report statistical results.  It is currently in beta and may not be reliable or accurate in all cases, and currently only works for the English Wikipedia.  The tool searches through the wikitext of RfA pages which have been edited by the Username specified below, and attempts to find their vote by searching for their signature on the page.  If the signature of the user doesn't always include their username, then you may need to specify an alternate username so that the tool can identify those votes (e.g. if the user made a username change, or if the user's signature links to a different user page which redirects to their user page).  This is not common and can be left blank in most cases.<br /><br />
You can also specify the maximum number of RfA's to search through (maximum is 250 at this time).  In some cases, the number of RfA's displayed will be less than the maximum number specified.  This can happen when a user edits an RfA page but doesn't vote (e.g. just leaves a comment).<br />
