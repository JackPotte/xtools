<h1>Snottywong's Tools</h1>
I'm Snottywong, and I usually contribute only to the English Wikipedia under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Snottywong">User:Snottywong</a>.  I have recently created a toolserver account and have a few tools up and running, as described below.  For the moment, the tools focus on statistics relating to both deletion and new page patrolling on the English Wikipedia.  If you have any questions, suggestions, or bug reports, please leave me a message on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Snottywong">my talk page</a>.
